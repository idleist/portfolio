                p I wanted to include this portfolio within my projects pages.  I built this site in NodeJS, using the pug templating language.  The portfolio has a working contact form using the Nodemailer package.  Form validation is included server-side with the express-validator package.  I have utilised SCSS for styling, as I can use cross site global variables and mixins for reusable code.

                p I wanted to add some personalisation to the website.  I have used svgâ€™s designed in Inkscape to add interest to the page.  My backdrop for the about section is a representation of my career journey from conservationist to developer.

                p I love working with Inkscape and designing simple, representative images for use in my webpages.
